# C-riminal database
A small project using C and csv to fetch and display records of criminals (a project for college)

## Problem statement 
Write a C program which displays the details of a criminal in the polics station. the name of the criminal is sent as a parameter to a function which displays the details of the criminal such as his name, his criminal record, place of birth, the term for which he is held in imprisonment and other details. If the name doesn't match the existing names then a message should be displayed as "Record not found".

## Working principle
The program has its database stored in a csv file where the user, or say the policemen can enter the database using either a text editor or microsoft execl. Where the program is run the C file fetches all the data from the csv file and prints it on the screen.

## Upcoming features
The program has yet to implement a searching algorithm for the user to find the correct database. For example if the user searches of Bellic, the program would print all the data about Roman Bellic.

## Sources
The criminal datbase is pulled from GTA4 criminal database as not to match any real person.
